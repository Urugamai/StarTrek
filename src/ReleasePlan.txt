BUGS
====
- Galaxy size increase may exceed galaxy view box - need to alter font size according to galaxy size.
    FIXED IN VERSION: ...
- Change to impulse setting while in motion does not seem to work
-  Impulse drive just keeps accelerating - set a MAXIMUM SPEED. (or Energy consumption might also help)
-  Torpedoes travel too slow?

Version 0.9
===========
    - computer commands to calculate angle to target(s) (write to notes section of computer window)
    - Output user game statistics on exit of gameloop (Win/Lose, stardate delta, kills, rating, promotions?, etc)
        - pause on exit of game until user enters ESC

Version 0.x
===========
- Enemies 'Follow you' - even across sectors. Once you have been seen they will track you until you are more than 2
  sectors away, (then they will continue on the path they were on?). I.e. enemy have LRS as well, just that it finds you and starbases

Version 0.x
===========
- ship status view damage report diagram

Version 0.x
===========
- Enemies fight back
    - Torpedo and Phaser capabilities

Version 0.x
===========
- Better Audio files

Version 0.x
===========
- Torpedo Enhancements
    - life of a torpedo can be reduced by setting it on the launch command
    - torpedoes will NOT create new sectors, they self destruct on entering the unknown.
    - Arming Delay (1 seconds) - once armed it can destroy YOU too!  Theory is you could get killed by same explosion.

Version 0.x
===========
- Damage
    - Add various things that can get damaged
        - Phasers
        - torpedo tubes
        - Impulse drive
        - warp core
        - Warp Nacelles
        - generators
        - computer
            - navigation
            - targeting
            - command (fast repair time as long as there is at least 1 repair crew to do it)
        - Physical Ship (as a %)
            - reduces repair crews
            - reduces efficiency?
    - Add to all relavant vessels (enterprise, romulans, starbases, etc)

Version 0.x
===========
- Shields
    - Balanced by default
    - Can manually set balance for front, back, port and starboard to re-allocate remaining shield energy
    - shields have little effect on torpedoes
        - Minor course alteration (similar calculation to Gravity but away from shielded vessel)

Version 0.x
===========
- Damage Control
    - Repair crews (n at start)
    - commands to allocate 'n' crews to damaged area(s)
- Damage
    - Add death of repair crews (reduces n)
- Add audio for
    - damage
    - Repair completion

Version 0.x
===========
- StarBase REPAIR of your ship
    - Use (CurrentEnergy/MaxEnergy) of starbase to determine % effectiveness of repairs
    - Instant restore n% repair crews
    - Repairs run n% of 10 times quicker at base
    - recharge energy is n% of 10 times quicker at base
    - Some damage can ONLY be repaired at starbase
        - Impulse drive
        - warp nacelles
        - Physical ship damage

Version 0.x (Rethink about this...)
===========
- Torpedo Tubes
    - can launch 'n' torpedoes at once where n is the number of tubes available
    - Each torpedo can be sent in a different direction
    - numeric count (limit) of available torpedoes

************************************************************************************************************************

Version 0.1 DONE
===========
- DONE: Basic game play
    - DONE: Quadrant with YOU, Enemy, Star, StarBase
    - DONE: Command interface
        - Does lwjgl have a text window ability (NO) - implement in own class GameText
    - DONE: Torpedo
        - straight line for now, be ready for gravity calculations in the future
        - FUEL
            - The destructive power of a torpedo is purely based on the fuel it carries at time of impact
            - as the fuel is used the destructive force reduces
            - once out of fuel the torpedo self destructs using the primer charge that would have detonated the fuel
    - DONE: Hit detection

Version 0.2 DONE
===========
- DONE: Movement
    - DONE: YOU
    - DONE: Turn in direction provided
    - DONE: Impulse drive (in sector only for now)
    - DONE: Impulse Drive - Use 'acceleration' to get to new 'speed' selected.

Version 0.3 DONE
===========
- DONE: Galactic Map
    - DONE: DOES NOT PAUSE game operation
    - DONE: Only shows sector details for ones you have seen with LRS and then only as they were when the lrs was run
- DONE: Ship status (down right side or a new screen?  Torp count, energy levels (Total, % shields, etc), )

Version 0.4 DONE
===========
- revisit?: Was GRAVITY but after a week of implementation it would seem to be a problem at this scale
     - DONE: Move rotation from Sprite to Entity (sprite keeps the 'draw at angle') and override rate settings in the
             relevant super entities so that each can rotate at different rates

Version 0.5 DONE
===========
- Movement
    - DONE: Need sectors to be joined? - currently it is just the 'void' between solar systems that never ends-think about it
    - DONE: Other fixes:
        - DONE: Made galaxy dynamically sized.
        - ABANDONED: impulse travel now crosses sector boundaries
        - DONE: STOP command now SLOWS to zero rather than instantaneous halt ;-)
    - DONE: WARP Drive!  Travel across sector boundary
        - ABANDONED: Accelerate to full impulse before enabling WARP drive

Version 0.6 DONE
===========
- DONE: Add energy capability to all ships (Enterprise, Romulans, StarBase)
    - DONE: add new Entity Types and superset of Entity (ShipEntity, ObjectEntity)
        - DONE: move Warp and other movement parameters to ShipEntity so Objects do not have movement capability
    - DONE: energy display (structural integrity and shields too)

Version 0.7 DONE
===========
- DONE: Phasers
    - IRRELEVANT: Lightspeed travel of beam
    - REPLACED with broadcast attack to ALL enemies in sector, each get a share of the energy allocated: Straight line
    - DONE: Beam energy reduced over distance until it reaches zero (should normally be able to reach about 0.75 of quadrant?)
    - DONE: cannot shoot into other quadrants - there is interstellar 'space' between the sectors within which the beam degrades to zero

Version 0.8
===========
- Add STARDATE
    - DONE: WARP jumps sectors
        - i.e. long trips are quick in elapsed user time but take a number of 'days' to do (stardate update)
    - ABANDONED: Crossing sector boundaries adds a 'chunk of time' to the date to illustrate there is 'space' between sectors.
        - What does this mean for torpedoes crossing the boundary?
        - boring - dont do it.
- DONE: STOP command to 'slow down to zero' rather than instantly stop.

    - Sectors are hexagonal
        - moving out of one into the next is now in 6 directions
        - moving out of edge sector of galaxy enters at edge sector at other end - so, galaxy like a soccer ball

- Multiplayer
    - more than one Enterprise Class vessel
        - Count of enemy vessels will need to become N * NumberOfPlayers
    - option to be on the non-federation side??
    - BIGGER universe needed to accommodate all the extra players, vessels, etc and to spread them out
- Negotiation
    - Ability to negotiate a peace (only after clearing the whole federation space of that enemy?)
        - backstabbing probability (they break the peace deal)
        - Insult (you shot after they offer peace) increases enemy numbers
- Incursion
    - Enemy dont start 'randomly throughout the federation' but instead
        - infiltrate from their 'side'
        - move ACROSS federation space towards the opposite side
        - have high density near their border and reducing as they cross federation space
            - i.e. lots of ships enter but at each sector some stop while the rest continue
    - Enemies attack any ship that is NOT one of their own

OTHER THOUGHTS
==============
- Should we have a Mouse-click option for direction/target/move as well as commands?  Mouse could be a 'damageable' item!
- GRAVITY - Doing these calculations proves that... gravity sucks!  Have implemented Motion class but need to
            deactivate as sensible scaling is impractical.  Perhaps revisit one-day
    - For orbits, gravity, etc it may be worthwhile changing from x,y coordinates to Heading,Velocity.
    - Need to add 'vector' class for direction of motion, gravitational calculations, etc
    - Affect ships? (sucks them towards star)
    - affects torpedo path (a lot?)
    - affects phaser path (no - too light and fast and short range)
    - does not affect starbase normally (maintains position itself until computer is 'damaged' item, then decay orbit)
    - does not affect ships docked to starbase

NOTES
=====
BORG = 400% of Romulan
Sector scale is ~10 light seconds? (about the most people will wait for a phaser beam to travel its path)
    - how does this compare with 'solar system'?
    - Should we have 'planets' in the sector?


Opening Address
================

You are the Captain of the Starship Enterprise.  Your mission is to save the Federation from the Romulan invasion.
Do well and you will be allocated better starships and be requested to explore strange new worlds
and to boldly go where no man has gone before.  Do badly and you will be demoted to lesser craft where it will be
harder for you to redeem yourself and regain your status.

The Federation Space map has been compressed, the empty space between sectors is not evident but if you travel out of
current sector on impulse drive then automated systems will activate the Warp Drive to get you to the next sector
in a very short time.

Information in the sector is provided
to you via probes that the federation has seeded throughout our space and as they are small and fast they cannot be
found and/or destroyed but if you go out of their range then you are on your own.

Torpedo's will damage and possibly destroy anything, even friendly units, as they assume you know what your are doing
when sending one out.  Dont get it wrong or you may make more enemies.

The visible sector on your main display covers a local area of space.  As phasers are light your display will not
indicate phaser fire from the enemy, but
you will feel its effects.  Torpedoes on the other hand, travel noticeably slower and so scanner reflections can
see both our and the enemy's torpedoes in transit.

Starbases can be destroyed and are targets to the enemy.  Starbases have no defensive capabilities as all the best
captains are now on starships saving the federation and so the bases are running on automatic.
It may pay to go to those sectors early and clean them out before the enemy destroy the starbase.  The enemy can
also use the starbase to recharge themselves taking valuable resources away from you and your ship.

Actions take energy, fortunately this is recharged slowly during normal operations and can be rapidly refilled when
docked to a starbase.

The enemy ships are an equal match to your own, however, they are aliens so their strategies and abilities may leave
you openings to attack and hopefully win this war.  Be careful as they will learn from your actions and become
increasingly harder to eliminate.

The computer understands a number of commands but they must be entered correctly or they will not work.  The
commands are;

DONE
====
TOR,direction[,maxlife]      -   direction is a decimal number of degrees at which the torpedo will be targeted.  Use the
                                computer to get assistance in generating the coordinate but bear in mind that gravitational
                                effects are far to complicated and variable for the computer to predict.
                                Max life is in seconds and cannot be over the max life of a torpedo.
IMP,direction,power,duration -   Impulse engines used to move around within a star system.  Does not stop until ordered.
                                power is % of full (0 - 100), duration is in seconds.  Ship will accelerate for the
                                duration given and then coast at the velocity arrived at.
WARP,direction,range        -   Turn in the direction indicated and activate warp drive. Range is roughly the number of
                                sectors travelled over.  Note that travelling at an angle will not necessary cross as
                                many sectors as you have entered.  Get out your trigonometry and pythagoras notes to
                                understand the distance travelled.
SRS                         -   Add current sector details to the galactic map.
LRS                         -   Add the current and 8 surrounding sectors to the galactic map.
STOP                        -   Computer calculates and implements impulse forces necessary to come to a full stop
SHUP                        -   Turn ON shields
SHDOWN                      -   Turn OFF Shields
EXIT                        -   Quit game.  ESC Key is also meant to work.
COMP TGT [BSE]              -   Compute angle and distance to Base, Star or all Enemy in current sector
COMP NAV [BE] {n}           -   Compute angle and distance to nearest sector with a Base or Enemy or with n Enemy

TODO
====
SH,Energy                   -   Transfer energy from main banks to boost shield percentage (1 for every 10 units of energy?)
AS                          -   ABANDON SHIP.  Everyone into life pods to fight again another day, albeit in a lesser craft.
PHA,direction,power         -   fire Phasers in the direction indicated with start power at the level indicated.  Power
                                will decrease by 1% (10%?) per lightsecond travelled.
MINE                        -   Places a mine at the location of the ship - make sure you are moving as it will
                                damage you after 10 seconds (arming delay).

PROBABLY WONT NEED
==================
- Not doing orbits
ORB,range                   -   go into orbit of the star at a distance of 'range' light-seconds (Needs GRAVITY implemented)
- decided to auto-dock at slow enough velocity
DOCK                        -   connect with starbase - you must be reasonably close for this to work as the starbase
                                autopilot uses bluetooth to reduce detection by the enemy
