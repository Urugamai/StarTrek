Version 0.1
===========
- Basic game play
    - DONE: Quadrant with YOU, Enemy, Star, StarBase (dumb pictures)
    - Command interface
        - Does lwjgl have a text window ability (NO) - implement in own class GameText
        - Should we have a Mouse-click option for direction/target/move rather than commands to make it happen?
    - Torpedo
        - straight line for now, be ready for gravity calculations in the future
        - numeric count of available torpedoes
    - Hit detection (already there?)
        - NO damage calc, etc yet

Version 0.2
===========
- Movement
    - YOU
    - Romulans - computer smarts
    - Impulse drive (in sector and across sector boundary)
- Graphics
    - Starship Enterprise
    - Romulan vessel
- Audio
    - add any sound for
        - movement (separate warp and impulse noises in future)
        - torpedo
        - Hits
        - Computer accepting commands

Version 0.3
===========
- Add energy capacity to all ships (Enterprise, Romulans, StarBase, Borg, etc)
- Phasers
    - Lightspeed travel of beam
    - Straight line for now, gravity later
    - Beam energy reduced over distance until it reaches zero (should normally be able to reach about 0.75 of quadrant?)
    - can shoot into other quadrants?

Version 0.4
===========
- Graphics
    - 3D Star picture
    - StarBase
- Torpedo Tubes
    - can launch 'n' torpedoes at once where n is the number of tubes available
    - Each torpedo can be sent in a different direction
- Warp drive (to new sector)
    - Sucked out of warp if crossing a sector with high concentration of enemy vessels)

Version 0.5
===========
- Graphics
    - rotate the ship sprites into the direction of travel, direction of torpedo launch, phaser fire
- Enemies fight back
    - Torpedo and Phaser capabilities
- Better Audio files

Version 0.6
===========
- Damage
    - Add various things that can get damaged
        - Phasers
        - torpedo tubes
        - Impulse drive
        - warp core
        - Warp Nacelles
        - generators
        - computer
            - navigation
            - targeting
            - command (fast repair time as long as there is at least 1 repair crew to do it)
        - Physical Ship (as a %)
            - reduces repair crews
            - reduces efficiency?
    - Add to all relavant vessels (enterprise, romulans, starbases, etc)

Version 0.7
===========
- Shields
    - Balanced by default
    - Can manually set balance for front, back, port and starboard to re-allocate remaining shield energy
    - shields have little effect on torpedoes
        - Minor course alteration (similar calculation to Gravity but away from shielded vessel)

Version 0.8
===========
- Damage Control
    - Repair crews (n at start)
    - commands to allocate 'n' crews to damaged area(s)
- Damage
    - Add death of repair crews (reduces n)
- Add audio for
    - damage
    - Repair completion

Version 0.9
===========
- GRAVITY
    - Affect ships? (sucks them towards star)
    - affects torpedo path (a lot)
    - affects phaser path (not much?)
    - does not affect starbase (maintains position itself)
    - does not affect ships docked to starbase
- StarBase Recharge
    - Instant restore all repair crews
    - Repairs run 10 times quicker at base
    - recharge energy is 10 times quicker at base
    - Some damage can ONLY be repaired at starbase
        - Impulse drive
        - warp nacelles
        - Physical ship damage

Version 1.0
===========
- Demotion vessels
    - Spaceship (50% of Enterprise)
    - Cruiser (35%)
    - Shuttle (20% of Enterprise)
    - Saucer Section (10% of Enterprise, moves SLOWLY, a torpedo tube, a phaser, not much energy, strong shields)
    - Garbage Scow (5% of Enterprise)
- Promotion vessels
    - BattleStar (300% of Enterprise)
        - Forces the BORG into the game
            - BORG can be introduced earlier by
                - crossing out of 'federation' space
                - High 'Kill to StarBase visit' ratio (strong player)

Version 1.1
===========
- Exploration
    - Travel outside federation space introduces new enemies - Out of federation space the sectors are 'full' of relevant enemy
        - BORG out side 1
        - (those nasty trans-dimensional insectoids) out side 2
        - Romulans out side 3
        - ??? out side 4
- Commands to split/join the Enterprise
    - BattleBridge (110% of Enterprise but less staff (repair crews, etc))
    - Saucer Section (10% of Enterprise but 200% sheilds)

Version 2.0
===========
- Multiplayer
    - more than one Enterprise Class vessel
        - Count of enemy vessels will need to become N * NumberOfPlayers
    - option to be on the non-federation side??
    - BIGGER universe needed to accommodate all the extra players, vessels, etc and to spread them out
- Negotiation
    - Ability to negotiate a peace (only after clearing the whole federation space of that enemy)
        - backstabbing probability (they break the peace deal)
- Incursion
    - Enemy dont start 'randomly throughout the federation' but instead
        - infiltrate from their 'side'
        - move ACROSS federation space towards the opposite side
        - have high density near their border and reducing as they cross federation space
            - i.e. lots of ships enter but at each sector some stop while the rest continue
    - Enemies attack any ship that is NOT one of their own

NOTES
=====
BORG = 400% of Romulan
Sector scale is ~10 light seconds? (about the most people will wait for a phaser beam to travel its path)
    - how does this compare with 'solar system'?
    - Should we have 'planets' in the sector?
