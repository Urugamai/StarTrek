Version 0.1 DONE
===========
- Basic game play
    - DONE: Quadrant with YOU, Enemy, Star, StarBase (dumb pictures)
    - DONE: Command interface
        - Does lwjgl have a text window ability (NO) - implement in own class GameText
    - DONE: Torpedo
        - straight line for now, be ready for gravity calculations in the future
    - DONE: Hit detection

Version 0.2 DONE
===========
- Movement
    - DONE: YOU
    - DONE: Turn in direction providing shortest angle change
    - DONE: Impulse drive (in sector only for now)

Version 0.3
===========

    - DONE: DOES NOT PAUSE game operation (if possible)
    - DONE: Only shows sector details for ones you have seen with LRS
    - DONE: Shows all starbase Sectors as they are where the federation put them so LRS to find them is not necessary

Version 0.4
===========
- Movement
    - WARP Drive!  Travel across sector boundary
        - Accelerate (currently instantaneous :-( ) to full impulse before enabling WARP drive
        - WARP still travels through space, just a LOT faster, can hit stuff, etc.
            - i.e. long trips travel 'through' the intervening sectors
            - collision detection to eject ship from warp just before hitting

    - Lightspeed travel of beam
    - Straight line for now, gravity later
    - Beam energy reduced over distance until it reaches zero (should normally be able to reach about 0.75 of quadrant?)
    - cannot shoot into other quadrants - there is interstellar 'space' between the sectors within which the beam degrades to zero

===========
- Add STARDATE

Version 0.x

        - Physical Ship (as a %)
            - reduces repair crews
            - reduces efficiency?
    - Add to all relavant vessels (enterprise, romulans, starbases, etc)

Version 0.x
===========
- Shields
    - Balanced by default
    - Can manually set balance for front, back, port and starboard to re-allocate remaining shield energy
    - shields have little effect on torpedoes
        - Minor course alteration (similar calculation to Gravity but away from shielded vessel)

Version 0.x

                - High 'Kill to StarBase visit' ratio (strong player)

VERSION 1.2
===========
- RELEASE

Version 1.2.x
===========
- GRAVITY
    - For orbits, gravity, etc it may be worthwhile changing from x,y coordinates to Heading,Velocity.
    - Need to add 'vector' class for direction of motion, gravitational calculations, etc
    - Affect ships? (sucks them towards star)
    - affects torpedo path (a lot?)
    - affects phaser path (no - too light and fast and short range)
    - does not affect starbase normally (maintains position itself until computer is 'damaged' item, then decay orbit)
    - does not affect ships docked to starbase

Version 1.2.x
===========
- PLANETS (between 0 and 9 per sector)
    - Needs orbital calculation
    - Need a graphic or several - smaller inner and larger outer planets (can sprites be resized?)
    - Planets are allocated starting from large outer and working inwards until planet count reached
    - Orbits are at (min(width, height) - 100) / planetCount increments from centre (use as distance from star)
    - move very slowly - faster inner and slower outer planets
    - collisions kill
    - Objects to avoid orbital paths on initial placement (StarBases, ships, etc)
    - Make star SMALLER

    - Saucer Section (10% of Enterprise but 200% sheilds)

VERSION 1.3
===========
- RELEASE

Version 2.0 BETA
================
- Multiplayer
    - more than one Enterprise Class vessel
        - Count of enemy vessels will need to become N * NumberOfPlayers
    - option to be on the non-federation side??
    - BIGGER universe needed to accommodate all the extra players, vessels, etc and to spread them out
- Negotiation
    - Ability to negotiate a peace (only after clearing the whole federation space of that enemy?)
        - backstabbing probability (they break the peace deal)
        - Insult (you shot after they offer peace) increases enemy numbers
- Incursion
    - Enemy dont start 'randomly throughout the federation' but instead
        - infiltrate from their 'side'
        - move ACROSS federation space towards the opposite side
        - have high density near their border and reducing as they cross federation space
            - i.e. lots of ships enter but at each sector some stop while the rest continue
    - Enemies attack any ship that is NOT one of their own

OTHER THOUGHTS
==============
- Should we have a Mouse-click option for direction/target/move as well as commands?  Mouse could be a 'damageable' item!

BUGS
=====
1.  For some reason the lwjgl audio library crashes on initialisation sometimes.  Restart the application is the
    work-around until the cause can be identified.  Possibly find a way to detect failure before app crash and try again?
2.  next...

NOTES
=====
BORG = 400% of Romulan
Sector scale is ~10 light seconds? (about the most people will wait for a phaser beam to travel its path)
    - how does this compare with 'solar system'?
    - Should we have 'planets' in the sector?


Opening Address
================

You are Captain of the Starship Enterprise.  Your mission is to save the Federation from the Romulan invasion
currently underway.  Due to the significance of this attack, you will be promoted or demoted as you progress.
Do well and you will be allocated better starships and be requested to explore strange new worlds and to go
where no man has gone before.  Do badly and you will be demoted to lesser craft where it will be harder for
you to redeem yourself and regain your status.

Torpedo's are smart enough not to destroy the ship they start at but they will damage and possibly destroy anything
else, even friendly units, as they assume you know what your are doing.  Dont get it wrong or you may make more
enemies.

The visible sector on your main display covers a 10 by 10 light-second area of space.  Hence, even
phaser fire can be seen travelling to the target.  Note that the phaser fire display is computer generated as you
cannot 'see' the phaser beam.  This also means that your display will not indicate phaser fire from the enemy, but
you will feel its effects.  Torpedoes on the other hand, travel noticeably slower and so scanner reflections can
see both our and the enemy's torpedoes in transit.

Starbases report SRS results via sub-space communications.  It may pay to go to those sectors early and clean them out
before the enemy destroy the starbase.

Actions take energy, fortunately this is recharged slowly during normal operations and can be rapidly refilled when
docked to a starbase.

The computer understands a number of commands but they must be entered correctly or they will not work.  The
commands are;

DONE
====
TOR,direction           -   direction is a decimal number of degrees at which the torpedo will be targeted.  Use the
                            computer to get assistance in generating the coordinate but bear in mind that gravitational
                            effects are far to complicated and variable for the computer to predict.
IMP,direction,power     -   Impulse engines used to move around within a star system.  Does not stop until ordered.
                            power is % of full (0 - 100).
                            Moving can be good as it makes you harder to hit, but also makes it harder for you to
                            hit the enemy.
SRS                     -   Add current sector details to the galactic map.
LRS                     -   Add the current and 8 surrounding sectors to the galactic map.
STOP                    -   Computer calculates and implements impulse forces necessary to effective stop in space
EXIT                    -   Quit game.  ESC Key is also meant to work.

TODO
====
WARP,direction,range    -   Turn in the direction indicated and activate warp drive. Range is roughly the number of
                            sectors travelled over.  Note that travelling at an angle will not necessary cross as
                            many sectors as you have entered.  Get out your trigonometry and pythagoras notes to
                            understand the distance travelled.
ORB,range               -   go into orbit of the star at a distance of 'range' light-seconds
DOCK                    -   connect with starbase - you must be reasonably close for this to work as the starbase
                            autopilot uses bluetooth to reduce detection by the enemy
AS                      -   ABANDON SHIP.  Everyone into life pods to fight again another day, albeit in a lesser craft.
PHA,direction,power     -   fire Phasers in the direction indicated with start power at the level indicated.  Power
                            will decrease by 1% (10%?) per lightsecond travelled.
COMP,
