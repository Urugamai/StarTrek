- 	Enemies 'Follow you' - even across sectors. Once you have been seen they will track you until you are more than 2
  	sectors away, (then they will continue on the path they were on?). I.e. enemy have LRS as well, just that it finds you and starbases
-	Set slight movement on landing in sector - you and enemy vessels - enemy AI needs to be able to avoid collisions first
-	Make angles match trigonometry, 0 to the right and anti-clockwise from there.  currently 0 down and clockwise.
- 	Damage
    - Add various things that can get damaged
        - Phasers
        - torpedo tubes

    - commands to allocate 'n' crews to damaged area(s)
- 	Damage
    - Add death of repair crews (reduces n)
- 	Better Audio files
	- Phaser fire
	- various hits (you, them, planet, star, etc) - technically incorrect as no sound in space - call it a battle sound simulation
    - movement (separate warp and impulse noises in future)
	- Computer command processing
    - damage
    - Repair completion
- 	StarBase REPAIR of your ship
    - Use (CurrentEnergy/MaxEnergy) of starbase to determine % effectiveness of repairs
    - Instant restore n% repair crews
    - Repairs run n% of 10 times quicker at base
    - recharge energy is n% of 10 times quicker at base
    - Some damage can ONLY be repaired at starbase
        - Impulse drive
        - warp nacelles
        - Physical ship damage
- 	ship status view damage report diagram
-	Damage graphics, small, medium, large, total destruction - animated gif style

-   Name the planets in a sector
- 	Output user game statistics on exit of gameloop (Win/Lose, stardate delta, kills, rating, promotions?, etc)
	- pause on exit of game until user enters ESC
-	Places a mine at the location of the ship - make sure you are moving as it will damage you after 10 seconds (arming delay).
	Uses the MINE command in the computer.  (essentially a non-moving torpedo - in fact, takes from your torpedo count)
-	ABANDON SHIP.  Everyone into life pods to fight again another day, albeit in a lesser craft. ('AS' command)

POSSIBLE NEW FEATURES to be considered
======================================
- Galaxy size by parameter
	- increase may exceed galaxy view box so need to alter font size according to galaxy size.
- have docked ship rotate around with the starbase rotation.
- Enemy Smarts - move smarter, attack smarter, learn from player actions, ...
- Demotion vessels
    - BattleBridge (Split Enterprise) (110% of Enterprise but harder to hit (smaller))
    - Spaceship (50% of Enterprise)
    - Cruiser (35%)
    - Shuttle (20% of Enterprise)
    - Saucer Section (10% of Enterprise, moves SLOWLY, a torpedo tube, a phaser, not much energy, strong shields)
    - Garbage Scow (5% of Enterprise)
    - Escape Pod ( 2% of Enterprise)
    - space suit (0% of Enterprise, you have a hand phaser)
    - Holloween version - Space Zombie - cant DO anything but watch as the enemy destroy starbases, etc. Can scare the enemy into leaving the sector?
- Promotion vessels
    - BattleStar (300% of Enterprise)
        - Forces the BORG into the game
            - BORG can be introduced earlier by
                - crossing out of 'federation' space
                - High 'Kill to StarBase visit' ratio (strong player)
                - time limit (i.e. dont clear out the romulans within n-stardates then the Borg also appear)
- Shields
    - Balanced by default
    - Can manually set balance for front, back, port and starboard to re-allocate remaining shield energy
- Torpedo Tubes
    - can launch 'n' torpedoes at once where n is the number of tubes available
    - Each torpedo can be sent in a different direction
    - numeric count (limit) of available torpedoes
- Fork Phone Version
    - create new ReleasePlan_Phone.txt
- Exploration
    - Travel outside federation space introduces new enemies - Out of federation space the sectors are 'full' of relevant enemy
        - BORG out side 1
        - (those nasty trans-dimensional insectoids) out side 2
        - Romulans out side 3
        - ??? out side 4
- Commands to split/join the Enterprise
    - BattleBridge (110% of Enterprise but less staff (repair crews, etc))
    - Saucer Section (10% of Enterprise but 200% shields)
- Hexagonal Galaxy - SPHERICALish!
    - Sectors are hexagonal
        - moving out of one into the next is now in 6 directions
        - moving out of edge sector of galaxy enters at edge sector at other end - so, galaxy like a soccer ball

- Multiplayer
    - more than one Enterprise Class vessel
        - Count of enemy vessels will need to become N * NumberOfPlayers
    - option to be on the non-federation side??
    - BIGGER universe needed to accommodate all the extra players, vessels, etc and to spread them out
- Negotiation
    - Ability to negotiate a peace (only after clearing the whole federation space of that enemy?)
        - backstabbing probability (they break the peace deal)
        - Insult (you shot after they offer peace) increases enemy numbers
- Incursion
    - Enemy dont start 'randomly throughout the federation' but instead
        - infiltrate from their 'side'
        - move ACROSS federation space towards the opposite side
        - have high density near their border and reducing as they cross federation space
            - i.e. lots of ships enter but at each sector some stop while the rest continue
    - Enemies attack any ship that is NOT one of their own
- Should we have a Mouse-click option for direction/target/move as well as commands?  Mouse could be a 'damageable' item!
- GRAVITY - Doing these calculations proves that... gravity sucks!  Have implemented Motion class but need to
            deactivate as sensible scaling is impractical.  Perhaps revisit one-day
    - Needs orbital calculation
    - Need a graphic or several - smaller inner and larger outer planets (can sprites be resized?)
    - Planets are allocated starting from large outer and working inwards until planet count reached
    - Orbits are at (min(width, height) - 100) / planetCount increments from centre (use as distance from star)
    - move very slowly - faster inner and slower outer planets?
    - Objects to avoid orbital paths on initial placement (StarBases, ships, etc)
    - For orbits, gravity, etc it may be worthwhile changing from x,y coordinates to Heading,Velocity.
    - Need to add 'vector' class for direction of motion, gravitational calculations, etc
    - Affect ships? (sucks them towards star)
    - affects torpedo path (a lot?)
    - affects phaser path (no - too light and fast and short range)
    - does not affect starbase normally (maintains position itself until computer is 'damaged' item, then decay orbit)
    - does not affect ships docked to starbase

IMPLEMENTED
************************************************************************************************************************
Version 0.8.2
=============
- Change to impulse setting while in motion does not seem to work
	- yes it does, it is a new thrust direction, not the final heading which is a combination of the current movement
	  vector and the thrust induced vector.
- Impulse drive just keeps accelerating - set a MAXIMUM SPEED. (or Energy consumption might also help)
	- Increased energy consumption 10 times by the square of the excess speed - i.e. dont give commands that will make
	  you go faster than the maximum, it will allow some leakage over the maximum before halting thrust so be careful


Version 0.8.1
=============
-	Face a random direction on landing in a sector
- 	Torpedoes consume all their energy travelling - need to arrive with a reasonable amount of destructive force
-  	Torpedoes travel too slow? (Can tweak it further if need be)
- 	Enemies fight back
    - Torpedo and Phaser capabilities

Version 0.1.1 (version numbering error - ignore)
=============
- computer commands to calculate angle to target(s) (write to notes section of computer window)
- Torpedo Arming Delay (1 seconds) - once armed it can destroy YOU too!  Theory is you could get killed by same explosion.
- Fix alpha channel to remove the box overlap visuals

Version 0.8
===========
- Add STARDATE
    - DONE: WARP jumps sectors
        - i.e. long trips are quick in elapsed user time but take a number of 'days' to do (stardate update)

Version 0.7 DONE
===========
- DONE: Phasers
    - IRRELEVANT: Lightspeed travel of beam
    - REPLACED with broadcast attack to ALL enemies in sector, each get a share of the energy allocated: Straight line
    - DONE: Beam energy reduced over distance until it reaches zero (should normally be able to reach about 0.75 of quadrant?)
    - DONE: cannot shoot into other quadrants - there is interstellar 'space' between the sectors within which the beam degrades to zero

Version 0.6 DONE
===========
- DONE: Add energy capability to all ships (Enterprise, Romulans, StarBase)
    - DONE: energy display (structural integrity and shields too)

Version 0.5 DONE
===========
- STOP command now SLOWS to zero rather than instantaneous halt ;-)
- WARP Drive!  Travel across sector boundary

Version 0.3 DONE
===========
- DONE: Galactic Map
    - DONE: DOES NOT PAUSE game operation
    - DONE: Only shows sector details for ones you have seen with LRS and then only as they were when the lrs was run
- DONE: Ship status (down right side or a new screen?  Torp count, energy levels (Total, % shields, etc), )

Version 0.2 DONE
===========
- DONE: Movement
    - DONE: YOU
    - DONE: Turn in direction provided
    - DONE: Impulse drive (in sector only for now)
    - DONE: Impulse Drive - Use 'acceleration' to get to new 'speed' selected.

Version 0.1 DONE
===========
- DONE: Basic game play
    - DONE: Sector with YOU, Enemy, Star, StarBase
    - DONE: Command interface
        - Does lwjgl have a text window ability (NO) - implement in own class GameText
    - DONE: Torpedo
        - straight line for now, be ready for gravity calculations in the future
        - FUEL
            - The destructive power of a torpedo is purely based on the fuel it carries at time of impact
            - as the fuel is used the destructive force reduces
            - once out of fuel the torpedo self destructs using the primer charge that would have detonated the fuel
    - DONE: Hit detection

************************************************************************************************************************************************************

NOTES
=====
BORG = 400% of Romulan
Sector scale is ~10 light seconds? (about the most people will wait for a phaser beam to travel its path)
    - how does this compare with 'solar system'?
    - Should we have 'planets' in the sector?

Opening Address
================

You are the Captain of a Federation Starship ______.  Your mission is to save the Federation from the Alien invasion.
Do well and you will be promoted to better starships and be requested to explore strange new worlds
and to boldly go where no man has gone before.  Do badly and you will be demoted to lesser craft where it will be
harder for you to redeem yourself and regain your status.

Information in the sector is provided
to you via probes that the federation has seeded throughout our space and as they are small and fast they cannot be
found and/or destroyed but if you go out of their range then you are on your own.

The Federation Space map has been compressed, the empty space between sectors is not evident but if you travel out of
current sector on impulse drive then you will be out of sensor-probe contact and unable to see where you are.  The enemy
can still see you however!

Torpedo's will damage and possibly destroy anything, even friendly units, as they assume you know what your are doing
when sending one out.  Dont get it wrong or you may make more enemies.

The visible sector on your main display covers a local area of space.  As phasers are light your display will not
indicate phaser fire from the enemy, but
you will feel its effects.  Torpedoes on the other hand, travel noticeably slower and so scanner reflections can
see both our and the enemy's torpedoes in transit.

Starbases can be destroyed and are targets to the enemy.  Starbases have no defensive capabilities as all the best
captains are now on starships saving the federation and so the bases are running on automatic.  We have seen the
enemy take starbases for themselves and the energy and torpedoes seem to suit their craft just as much as ours.
It may pay to go to those sectors early and clean them out before the enemy destroy the starbase.  The enemy can
travel between sectors just like us and so they may invade a starbase sector even after you have made the are safe.

Actions take energy, fortunately this is recharged during normal operations and can be refilled faster when
docked to a starbase.

The enemy ships are an equal match to our own.  As they have just invaded Federation Space we are aware that their
power levels are low but it wont take them long to rebuild now that our defences are down and you are their only
opponent.  They are aliens so their strategies and abilities are
different to our own.  Be careful as they seem to learn from your actions and as their energy reserves build they will
become increasingly harder to eliminate.

Your ship computer understands a number of commands but it is an old system and so the commands must be entered
correctly or they will not work.

The commands are;

TOR direction				-	direction is a decimal number of degrees at which the torpedo will be targeted.  Use the
								computer to get assistance in generating the coordinate but bear in mind that gravitational
								effects are far to complicated and variable for the computer to predict.  you can
								use * to send one torpedo towards each enemy in the current sector.
PHA energy [direction]		-	fire Phasers at all targets using total of power indicated.  Power decreases with
								distance.  Power is equally divided between the targets prior to firing.
								If direction provided then all power is sent in that direction.
IMP direction energy duration -	Impulse engines are used to move around within a star system.
								power is % of full (0 - 100), duration is in seconds.  Ship will accelerate for the
								duration given and then coast at the velocity arrived at.
WARP direction range		-	Turn in the direction indicated and activate warp drive. Range is roughly the number of
								sectors travelled over.  Note that travelling at an angle will not necessary cross as
								many sectors as you have entered.  Get out your trigonometry and pythagoras notes to
								understand the distance travelled.
LRS							-	Update the current and 8 surrounding sectors in the galactic map.
STOP						-	Computer calculates and implements impulse forces necessary to come to a full stop.
								Typically takes about 3 seconds to come to a stop.
SHUP energy					-	Turn ON shields at indicated energy levels - take energy from main systems
SHDOWN						-	Turn OFF Shields.  Return energy to main systems - there is some transfer losses
EXIT						-	Quit game.  ESC Key also works.

TODO
====
COMP TGT [BSE]				-	Compute angle and distance to Base, Star or all Enemy in current sector
COMP NAV [BE] {n}			-	Compute angle and distance to nearest sector with a Base or Enemy or with n Enemy
AS							-	ABANDON SHIP.  Everyone into life pods to fight again another day, albeit in a lesser craft.
MINE						-	Places a mine at the location of the ship - make sure you are moving as it will
								damage you after 10 seconds (arming delay).

PROBABLY WONT NEED
==================
- Not doing orbits
ORB,range					-	go into orbit of the star at a distance of 'range' light-seconds (Needs GRAVITY implemented)
DOCK						-	connect with starbase - you must be reasonably close for this to work as the starbase
								autopilot uses bluetooth to reduce detection by the enemy
							-	decided to auto-dock at slow enough velocity
